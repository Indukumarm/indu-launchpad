        <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          I'm Indukumar Mallampali, a DevOps & Release Engineering leader with 9+ years of experience. 
          My career has been shaped around <strong>Insurance (Workers' Compensation, Guidewire apps)</strong> where 
          I've driven major <strong>Go-Lives and enterprise release programs</strong> that demanded both precision 
          and leadership.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground mt-6">
          My expertise goes beyond tools â€” I bring <strong>leadership, governance, and mentorship</strong> to 
          cross-functional teams, aligning DevOps practices with business strategy to deliver outcomes that scale.
