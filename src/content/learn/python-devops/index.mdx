# Python Scripting in DevOps

## Deployment Automation

```python
import boto3

# Deploy to ECS
ecs = boto3.client('ecs')
response = ecs.update_service(
    cluster='prod-cluster',
    service='myapp',
    forceNewDeployment=True
)
print(f"Deployed: {response['service']['serviceName']}")
```

## Log Parsing

```python
import re

with open('/var/log/nginx/access.log') as f:
    for line in f:
        if '500' in line:
            ip = re.search(r'(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', line).group(1)
            print(f"500 error from {ip}")
```
